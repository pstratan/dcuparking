The DCU Parking App is an Android App that allows users to view the level of cars in a car park. A lot of car parks these days still use the simple method of saying FULL or AVAILABLE but no info on exact number of spaces left or taken. In particular the DCU car park has no sign at all to inform the users if itâ€™s full or not until they get to the barrier of each car park.
This causes a lot of the drivers a huge inconvenience and especially a waste of time and money. From my own experience I would arrive on time and spend about 10-15 minutes at least to find a car park that has a parking space.
